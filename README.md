Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) Federal Integrated Business Framework initiative

## What is the Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF)?
The FIBF is a model that enables the Federal government to better coordinate and document common business needs across agencies, focusing on outcomes, data, and cross-functional end-to-end business processes. It is the essential first step towards standards that will drive economies of scale and leverage the governmentâ€™s buying power.
